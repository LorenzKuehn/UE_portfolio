In the folder "Unreal Scenes" you can find various screenshots of Environments i have build so far. 
In the folder "Project: Whisphers of Solitude" you can find the raw footage of some shots of a film project me and two other Students made in our small Virtual Production Studio in Mittweida.
Keep in mind: this is not color graded and doesnt have any post effects added to it yet, its just the raw footage of what we did so far. Thats why there are also some scenes missing.
Also keep in my mind that only 3 people worked on everything you can see in these scenes. We didnt have any professional Light setup for instance.
But still, i wanted to put this in here to showcase that I already made quite the Experience with working with a Virtual Production setup.
