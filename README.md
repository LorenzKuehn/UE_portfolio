In the "Unreal Scenes" folder, you’ll find various screenshots of environments I’ve created so far. In the "Project: Whispers of Solitude" folder, you’ll find the raw footage of some scenes from a film project that I worked on together with two other students in our small Virtual Production studio in Mittweida.

Keep in mind: this footage is neither color-graded nor does it have any post-effects applied—it’s just the raw material of what we’ve done so far. That’s also why some scenes are missing. Also, remember that everything you see in these shots was created by only three people. For example, we didn’t have a professional lighting setup. Still, I wanted to include this to showcase that I’ve already gained quite a bit of experience working with a Virtual Production setup.

The files are also highly compressed to save space. Unfortunately, I can’t upload them in full quality here.
